# Welcome to Open Source at UT Dallas
The goal of this organization is to get the UT Dallas community to work together and make awesome things

## Why are most of these repos just containers for json files?
JSON is a really nice comprimise between computer/human readability. Some of these repos are just collation of data that could be utilized by a project.

## How do I use these json files in my project?
There are several options:
- fetch the file from the raw github link and parse it
- create a REST api from the file
- convert it into another format
- use this data to seed your own databases

## How do I create a project here?
Simply create a issue in this repo and you will be added to the team, this will allow you to create repos in the organization

## I have data I would like to contribute but I don't want to put it into JSON
That's cool if you have a dataset you would like to contribute create a repo and upload a DB file, Spreadsheet or CSV and someone can use that to generate the json file for it
